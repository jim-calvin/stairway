# Stairway Lighting Project
## CircuitPython versions

The files here are an implementation of the Stairway lighting code in CircuitPython. There are two versions provided.
1. A Trinket M0 version that will run on the process specified in the original project. This version has limited functionality due to memory limitations.
2. An M4 Express version (tested on a Feather M4 Express) that is full featured.

*Note:* both versions were tested on the bench, but never in an actual setup. As a result, there may be bugs in the code.

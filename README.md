Stairway lighting project

This project uses two PIR sensors to light an LED strip in a stairwell. Included here is the Arudino based source code for a Trinket M0, and the Fritzing diagrams for the circuits involved.

See https://www.swaystairs.com/Stairway/ for a detailed description of this project.

Update:
The Python directory contains CircuitPython versions of the code base. There is one for the Trinket M0 used in the original project. But this version is reduced function because of space limitations when using CircuitPython on an M0.

The second version is full featured, but must run on an M4 based system. It was tested on a Feather M4 Express.

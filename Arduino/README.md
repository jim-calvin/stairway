# Stairway Lighting Project
## Arduino version

The files in this directory are the most recent implementation of the Arduino based version of the software. The code is an object-oriented version of the original implementation. Some improvements were added as well:
1. PIR handling is improved. Spurious (very short) motion indications are suppressed.
2. Additional animations were added.

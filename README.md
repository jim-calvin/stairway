Stairway lighting project

This project uses two PIR sensors to light an LED strip in a stairwell. Included here is the Arudino based source code for a Trinket M0, and the Fritzing diagrams for the circuits involved.

See https://www.swaystairs.com/Stairway/ for a detailed description of this project.
